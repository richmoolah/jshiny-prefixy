# jshiny-prefixy

## Purpose

Building the prefixy autocomplete algorithm and corresponding data structures as listed at https://prefixy.github.io/#introduction. This is primarily an exercise.

## Getting Started

This project currently uses Conan as a package manager for C++. To get started, we can install dependencies that we will be using with the command:

```
conan install conanfile.txt --build=missing
```

Which will locally install and build necessary missing dependencies.

## Current step

Currently trying to figure out how to use CMake to build this project.
